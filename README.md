   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
   Follow the prompts to describe your changes (patch, minor, or major).

2. **Version packages** to update `package.json` and generate changelog:
   ```bash
   pnpm version
   ```

3. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: version packages"
   ```

4. **Publish to npm**:
   ```bash
   pnpm release
   ```
   This will build and publish your package to npm.
